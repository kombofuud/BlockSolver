# BlockSolver
A tool that can take a rubiks cube scramble and find ergonomic ways to build 1x2x3 blocks as well as 2x2x3 blocks.

I wanted a tool that basically allows me to practice blockbuilding when using roux and petrus, but there are a finite number of example solves on the internet, and the roux block trainer uses a fixed block and only worries about movecount rather than ergonomics. Hopefully, this tool will be able to show solutions to multiple possible first blocks (and rank them) as well as find ergonomic solutions to the possible cases.
